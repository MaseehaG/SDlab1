        <h3> Latest Project </h3>
        <p>
            My latest project was building an AI agent of a Snake game for an assignment last year. I utilized the depth first search algorithm.
            The goal was to create the shortest path for my snake eat an apple and grow, as well as dodge enemy and zombie snakes, to avoid getting eaten.
            We were put up agaisnt other classmates on a leaderboard and my snake finished in the top 20.
